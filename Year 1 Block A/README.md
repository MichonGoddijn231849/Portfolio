# Sustainable Development Goals Dashboard

An interactive data analytics project tracking global progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on environmental sustainability and e-waste management.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the CRISP-DM Business Understanding module at Breda University of Applied Sciences. The objective was to create an interactive dashboard for the SDG Hub@BUas to help policymakers, researchers, and activists monitor and assess progress toward the SDGs on a global and country-specific scale.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** of SDG indicators using Python
- **Statistical Analysis** of e-waste recycling per capita across countries
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** for data visualization and insights
- **Data-driven insights** on global sustainability progress

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

The analysis focused on e-waste recycling metrics across different countries:
- **Mean e-waste recycled per capita:** 7.09 kg
- **Standard Deviation:** 4.63 kg
- **Range:** 0 to 23.76 kg per capita
- Identified significant disparities in e-waste management between nations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Data analysis and statistical computing
- **openpyxl** - Excel file processing
- **Power BI** - Interactive dashboard creation
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Analysis documentation
- **CRISP-DM Methodology** - Structured approach to data science

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `data_analysis_MichonGoddijn.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## 📈 Key Insights

1. **Global Disparities:** Significant variation in e-waste recycling capabilities across countries
2. **Top Performers:** Countries with highest recycling rates demonstrate strong environmental policies
3. **Areas for Improvement:** Many nations show minimal e-waste recycling infrastructure
4. **Policy Implications:** Data suggests need for international cooperation on e-waste management

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Applied CRISP-DM methodology to real-world business problem
- Developed skills in Python data analysis and visualization
- Created stakeholder-facing dashboard with Power BI
- Practiced presenting technical findings to non-technical audiences

## 📝 Project Deliverables

- Interactive Power BI dashboard with live demonstrations
- Statistical analysis of SDG indicators
- Data-driven recommendations for sustainability improvements
- Presentation to SDG Hub@BUas stakeholders
