## Project Description
This project evaluates the impact of various chatbot features—personalisation, perceived waiting times, accuracy, and functionality preferences—on customer satisfaction and trust within Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).

## Study Design and Data Processing
This study uses a mixed-methods approach, employing quantitative surveys to collect customer feedback and qualitative interviews to explore customer perceptions in greater depth. Data processing will involve cleaning, organizing, and analysing both types of data to identify correlations between chatbot features and customer satisfaction or trust. See associated documents for specific details on methodology.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

### Collection of the Raw Data
- **Quantitative Data**: Surveys are conducted through Qualtrics, focusing on customer satisfaction, chatbot accuracy, personalization, and waiting times. Responses use Likert scales to quantify satisfaction levels and trust.
- **Qualitative Data**: Semi-structured interviews capture detailed customer feedback on chatbot use and comparison to human agents.

### Notes on the Original (Raw) Data
- Quantitative data consists of 200 survey responses with Likert scale ratings.
- Interview transcripts contain anonymized qualitative feedback on chatbot interactions.

## Creating the Tidy Data File

### Guide to Create the Tidy Data File
1. **Download** survey data and interview transcriptions.
2. **Clean** the data by removing incomplete or duplicate responses.
3. **Organize** the data into structured CSV files for survey results and text files for interview data.
4. **Store** cleaned data for further analysis in a secure environment.

### Cleaning of the Data(N/A)
The cleaning script will:
- Remove duplicates and incomplete records.
- Standardize Likert scale responses.
- Anonymize interview data for privacy.
- Handle missing data using appropriate methods such as imputation and deletion of incomplete rows. (e.g., deletion or imputation). [Link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()
