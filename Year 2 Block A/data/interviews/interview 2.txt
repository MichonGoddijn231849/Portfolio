Build-up Questions

Question 1:

Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you tell me about your general experiences with customer service?

Interviewee: Yes, that varies a lot. One customer service is better than the other.

Question 2:

Interviewer: Okay, and how often do you use customer support via chatbots or humans?

Interviewee: I think about once a week.

Question 3:

Interviewer: Okay, and which channels do you usually prefer when contacting customer service—phone, email, live chat, or something else?

Interviewee: With live chat, I often get a quick response. Email takes a bit longer, so I'd rather not use that. And phone, I find that quite handy because you get immediate answers and can continue asking questions. But yes, most customer services are not reachable by phone. And a chatbot is handy because you can do other things in the meantime or don't always have to respond immediately. Yes, that.

Research Questions

Question 4:

Interviewer: Okay, can you describe a situation where a chatbot met or did not meet your expectations in solving a problem? How did this experience affect your trust in the company?

Interviewee: Hmm, let me think. So you're asking about a bad experience, right?

Interviewer: No, just any situation where the chatbot either met or did not meet your expectations.

Interviewee: Oh, so not live chat, but a chatbot.

Interviewer: Yes, it's about the principle. It can be with the chatbot or with humans.

Interviewee: But chat is often a person behind it who is just chatting with you.

Interviewer: Not very often, though. They're not immediately behind it. First, you're talking to the chatbot. But if it then comes up with "I don't know" or "I don't understand," then it's nice that it connects you to a human.

Interviewee: That last problem, what was it again? Yes, I had a problem with a software program. And then, yes, I chatted, but that was with a live person behind it. Does that count?

Interviewer: No, it's really about the chatbot, not humans.

Interviewee: Okay. Well, last night—not with me but with someone else—he had uploaded his CV to an employment agency, basically sent an open application. He uploaded his CV and then immediately got a text message from a chatbot. It asked all sorts of questions like when he could work, when he could start, what salary he wanted, and what kind of work he wanted. And that was, in itself, I found positive because you have immediate contact with the company. You can answer questions right away, so when they contact you, they already have some background information. Yes, I found that positive. So that had positive influences, so to speak.

Interviewer: Okay, so in that case, it met your expectations, and it would improve your trust.

Interviewee: Trust is, yes.

Interviewer: In the company.

Interviewee: Well, actually, it was more than that. I actually had no expectation that they would do that, so yes, positively surprised.

Question 5:

Interviewer: So you were surprised. Okay. And how important is the accuracy of the answers that chatbots give? Or yes, how important is the accuracy of the answers from chatbots and humans for your overall satisfaction and trust in the service provided?

Interviewee: Yes. It is important because if they don't give a good answer, then I don't have trust in the service.

Interviewer: Okay, so then you are less satisfied.

Interviewee: Yes.

Question 6:

Interviewer: Okay. What differences have you noticed in the way chatbots and humans handle tricky questions, and how do these differences affect your trust in the company?

Interviewee: Tricky questions. Yes, a chatbot, if you ask a tricky question and they don't know the answer, they often keep coming back with the same question that you might not be able to answer yourself. So you often don't get any further. You get stuck, so to speak. And yes, people can ask follow-up questions.

Interviewer: But that difference, how does that affect your trust in the company?

Interviewee: Yes, it's a bit frustrating if you have a chatbot that can't help you further.

Interviewer: Okay, so then...

Interviewee: So that's not good for trust.

Question 7:

Interviewer: Okay. One last question, how important is it to you that a chatbot can immediately connect you to a human when the chatbot cannot solve your problem? And again, what does that mean for your trust?

Interviewee: That's actually what we just—what I just said.

Interviewer: Yes.

Interviewee: If you get stuck, that's frustrating, so it's only good if the chatbot notices, "Well, we're not getting any further," and then immediately connects you.

Interviewer: To a human, yes, okay, so that would...

Interviewee: To a person, yes. And then, initially, it can go much faster with the chatbot. That always goes faster than waiting for a response from a human because they have to type a response. It always takes a bit longer than a chatbot.

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: So the combination is nice, so that you can first go through everything that can be handled by a chatbot. And if that doesn't work, then you go to a human.

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: That's the ideal.

Interviewer: So then your trust would increase.

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: Okay, well, those are all the questions.

Interviewee: Well, that's good.

Interviewer: Thank you for your time.
